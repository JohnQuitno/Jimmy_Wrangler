- Data Sets

In this project I look at Covid data since late february for US and Italy. I got this data from Kaggle and 
it has similar summary statistics for both countries. Things like test results, hospilization statistics, and 
intensive care statistics are included in these data sets.

- Loading into DataFrames and cleaning

The first thing that I did was make sure that the dates line up, are in the same format, and are the indices of 
the datasets. I used pd.to_datetime to do this for both datasets after modifying the date formats in the csv.

- Combining

I combined these datasets in a couple ways that I thought would be interesting. The first thing that I did was 
just look at the positivity rates of the two countries combined over the period given. I also wanted to look at
the hospilization rate. So I used the respective columns in the original data sets, combined them based on the date
of the released information and then looked at these summary statistics.

- Results

I found that positivity rates went down significantly over time. I believe that this is expected because testing 
capabilities drastically increased over this time period. The positivity rate was something like 16% at the beginning
of the pandemic and is now closer to 5% in our data. The trend in the hospilization rate is similar. Since there is 
significantly more testing that is being done, we are finding cases many more cases that are less severe. The
positivity rate has gone from nearly 25% to less than 5%.
